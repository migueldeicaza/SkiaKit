/**
 * `Path` contain geometry. `Path` may be empty, or contain one or more verbs that
 * outline a figure. `Path` always starts with a move verb to a Cartesian coordinate,
 * and may be followed by additional verbs that add lines or curves.
 * Adding a close verb makes the geometry into a continuous loop, a closed contour.
 * `Path` may contain any number of contours, each beginning with a move verb.
 *
 * `Path` contours may contain only a move verb, or may also contain lines,
 * quadratic beziers, conics, and cubic beziers. `Path` contours may be open or
 * closed.
 *
 * When used to draw a filled area, `Path` describes whether the fill is inside or
 * outside the geometry. `Path` also describes the winding rule used to fill
 * overlapping contours.
 *
 * The various commands that add to the path provide a fluid interface, meaning that
 * calling the methods return the instance on which it was invoked, easily allowing
 * the drawing operations to be concatenated.
